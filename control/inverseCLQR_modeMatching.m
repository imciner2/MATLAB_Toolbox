function [Q, R, S, P, Kopt] = inverseCLQR_modeMatching(K, A, B, R, Qform, a)
%INVERSECLQR_MODEMATCHING Solve the inverse LQR problem by matching system modes
%
% This function solves the inverse LQR problem (for continuous time) by
% matching system modes between the closed loop system with the input
% controller and the modes of the system with the LQR controller created
% using the estimated Q, S, and R matrices.
%
% Usage:
%  [Q, R, S, P, Kopt] = inverseCLQR(K, A, B, R, Qform, a)
%    Inputs:
%      K = The constant-gain matrix to 
%      A = The system's state transition matrix
%      B = The system's input matrix
%      R = The R matrix to use in the inverse problem
%      Qform = A matrix containing 1s in every location Q can have a value
%      a = Regularization parameter (must be >0)
%    Outputs:
%      Q = State wieghting matrix
%      R = Input weighting matrix (same as supplied)
%      S = State-Input corss term weighting matrix
%      P = Solution to the Algebraic Riccatti Equation
%      Kopt = Optimal controller
